## Introduction

![990v5_two](https://nb.scene7.com/is/image/NB/m990gl5_nb_03_i_53ec0edb36a941f18bfb?$dw_detail_main_lg$&bgc=f1f1f1&layer=1&bgcolor=f1f1f1&blendMode=mult&scale=10&wid=1600&hei=1600)

New Balance introduced this sneaker to the world in the spring of 1978. The designer team had *one* objective: make the best running shoe. No matter the time, no matter the cost. Thus, the 990 came to life. Continuing tradition, the fifth generation 990 combines cushioning and style for the perfect morning run or the most ultramodern outfit. 

New Balance MADE consists of a 70% or higher domestic value and is a restricted portion of New Balance's US sales.
